# GAN-based Image Generation

To create novel images utilizing Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), one can employ various GAN model generation frameworks. In this research endeavor, we opted for the straightforward framework provided by MMGeneration [MMGeneration repository](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmgeneration) to generate new samples. This modular framework facilitates ease of use for image generation based on GAN models.

## Usage

We provide our configurations, mirroring those employed in our work using MMGeneration /configs. For a comprehensive installation guide of this framework, please consult the [MMGeneration repository](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmgeneration).

## Citation

If you utilize this framework for generating new samples, kindly acknowledge the original MMGeneration work. Cite the relevant references to give proper credit to the framework.
